__Climate Intervention:__

Eath's climate is warming at an elevated rate due human activity. As international decarbonization progresses to slowly to mitigate anthropogenic warming, humanity must develop a tools to mitigate climate warming directly. I am interested in a variety of solar radiation management (SRM) strategies, with a current focus on surface albedo modification (SAM) of Arctic sea ice. I am also researching methods to slow the rate of global sea level rise (SRL) by enhancing butressing of marine terminating glaciers in order to reduce the SRL contribution of iceberg calving.

__Cryospheric Geophysics:__

Predicting and reacting to changes in the cryosphere as Earth's climate warms requires a robust understanding of Antarctic ice dynamics, yet the fracture processes that influence mass loss and ice shelf stability are poorly understood. Ice fracture not only controls iceberg calving on Earth, but also shapes the surfaces of icy satellites like Saturn's moon Enceladus, one of the most likely hosts of extraterrestrial life in the the solar system. In my work, I use seismological data and mechanical modeling to study coupled systems of ice fracture and ocean flow on Earth and beyond.

__Highlights of my research include:__

* Characterizing seismic recordings of kilometer-scale rift extension.
* Modeling interactions between fluid processes and ice shelf fracture.
* Modeling the bending of floating ice shelves in response to fracture.
